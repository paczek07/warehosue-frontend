# warehosue-frontend

This project is an improved version of a school project consisting of an order tracking system for a warehouse.
originally it consisted of simple frontend website that use plain vanilla HTM/CSS and JS. 
Now after one year I have decided to improve it making it a full stack project and try to emulate the whole software development lifecycle, from planning and documenting to use agile development pattern.

1. Frontend

   - React Router
   - Tailwindcss
2. Backend
   - Java Springboot
   - Maven
   - MongoDB
3. CI/CD, Testing and Documentation

## Design
The design was made using sketch mocking software for macOS, the first iteration was simple with big major UI/UX flaws, for this improved project many of this flaws were fixed trying to keep the theme of the project intact, this was done with the purpose to not change the essence of the project just to correct issues.
Some details were left out intentionally to keep simulating the lyfecicle of software development where after completing the minnimum requirements, then maintainance and improvement and adding features are developed.
